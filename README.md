> What's a bot?

A bot is a software that emulates a real game client in order to automate some tasks. Dindo is a **pixel** bot, which means that it uses screen pixels (+ your mouse & keyboard) to emulate actions & keep tracking the progress in game.

:warning: Better know that this bot is only available on [Linux](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) for now.

## Features

- **Easy control**: play, pause/resume or stop the bot like if you were using your favorite music player.
- **Smart bot**: Dindo knows when your connection turns off and will wait for it to get back before proceeding or will automatically pause itself if it takes a long time.
- **Multi accounts management**: you don't have to worry about switching between your accounts, Dindo can handle that for you :wink:.
- **Integrated Path & Maps builder**: easily create your own custom paths & farming maps.
- **Keyboard shortcuts**.

## Use Cases

- Auto-connect to your Dofus account(s).
- Move around the map & save time for long dungeon paths, [paths](paths) pull requests are welcome :pray:.
- Farming & jobs (:construction: this part still needs to be improved, also, the bot cannot handle fights yet :warning:).
- Automated actions like flood :speech_balloon:.

## To Know

- You cannot use your computer for something else while Dindo is running.
- Since the bot simulates normal human behavior, you have less chances to get spotted by the Anti-bot (less is not 0).
> Tips: For more safety, try changing bot paths from time to time.
- The main goal of this bot is to simplify repetitive tasks and reduce boredom during your gameplay.
- We do not encourage multi-boting and do not support it anyway (it destroys the server economy :grimacing:).
- Windows & Mac OS are not ~~yet~~ supported [#1](https://github.com/AXeL-dev/Dindo-Bot/issues/1) [#8](https://github.com/AXeL-dev/Dindo-Bot/issues/8).
